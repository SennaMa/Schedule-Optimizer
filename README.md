# Schedule Optimizer
WHAT: Create a schedule for a team incorporating an employee's preference on when they're available
WHY: I believe people work best when they're able to choose their own hours. Hopefully, this will provide employees with the flexibility to share when they're available, while aiding employers to 

Completed:
 1. Framework - how to gather inputs and what will the output look like 
 2. Conditions - which conditions and critera we require to restrict or allow for certain bookings
 3. Integration of Google's OR-tools - created a schedule using OR-tools. Next steps would be to work on iterations 2 and 3. 
 4. Iteration 1 - Program works and a schedule is created in 2.44 minutes. However, this is reliant on Py and Google 
 Spreadsheet. 
 
# Current Goal:
1. Read Clean Code by Robert C Martin
2. Iteration 2 
  * Incorporate your readings and clean your code
  * Continue to build off classes. We want this to be as easy as inputting the values and generating the schedule 
  * We'll continue to rely on the Spreadsheet for visualization purposes 
  * Think about usability (ie. how can anyone run?)
 
What's next:
 1. Iteration 3 - adding more complex layers to the schedule 
 2. Visualization - improving how the results are visualized. Currently this requires manual effort 
 3. Inputs - setting up a fool-proof way to gather inputs. This includes employee preferences and employer requirements
